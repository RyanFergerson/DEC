# Tips Hacks Configuration

## Why?
This repo was made for getting my developer environment set up quickly
across different computers; it also serves as an area to swiftly add new
techniques as I discover them (or lookup) and share them seamlessly between
remote and local computers.

I use macOS both at home and at work and Ubuntu for my remote computers so
my setups are primarily Unix based (although I plan to get a working setup
in Windows too).
